# Brand Framework

## Product narrative

You are building a secure, company-controlled agent platform that turns internal requests into client-ready deliverables. Instead of routing work to human owners, the platform routes requests to an AI Agent Owner (or cluster of agents) that produces the deliverable using controlled processes, templates, and governed access to company and end-client context. Humans then review, humanize, and deliver the final output to clients. MVP focuses on Design and Marketing deliverables.

## Vision Statement

Enable companies to reliably produce high-quality, professional client deliverables at scale by deploying governed AI agents that execute production work end-to-end, while keeping humans in control of final polish and client delivery, with enterprise-grade protection of company and end-client IP.

## Problem Statement

Service teams are expected to deliver a growing volume of recurring, high-stakes client outputs, but production depends on manual effort, scattered tools, and inconsistent execution. Even when AI is introduced, it often happens in unsecured, public tools that do not protect end-client IP or enforce how deliverables are produced. Companies need a secure, controlled system where AI agents can generate deliverables consistently using approved methods and guarded context, then hand off to humans for professional refinement and client-facing delivery.


## Key Objectives

- Agent-owned production: route requests to AI Agent Owners (or agent clusters) that complete deliverables, not to human assignees.
- Controlled output: allow companies to control what agents produce (deliverable types, formats, tone) and how they produce it (templates, steps, rules, approvals).
- Protected environment: restrict access to paying companies and enforce strong data isolation so end-client IP is protected.
- Human-in-control handoff: provide a clean review, editing, and packaging layer so humans can professionalize outputs before delivery.
- MVP focus: launch with Design and Marketing deliverable generation and delivery, then expand to Development, Sales, Strategy, Operations.

## Competitor Set

**Writer**

Writer competes because it positions itself as an enterprise platform for agentic work, with governance and security posture aimed at controlled deployment inside companies. It maps closely to your “agent owner or agent cluster” concept, even if your deliverable factory focus (design and marketing outputs handed to humans) is more specific.

**Jasper**

Jasper competes because it is purpose-built for marketing production with agents, brand control, and workflow automation. Your MVP (design + marketing deliverables) sits directly in Jasper’s value lane, but your differentiation is agent-owned completion plus stronger IP isolation and governed “how it produces” recipes.

**Typeface**

Typeface competes because it targets enterprises with on-brand marketing content generation, agentic components, and explicit positioning around data security. It overlaps with your goal of controlled, company-governed production for marketing deliverables.
