## Product narrative (updated anchor)

You are building a secure, company-controlled agent platform that turns internal requests into client-ready deliverables. Instead of routing work to human owners, the platform routes requests to an AI Agent Owner (or cluster of agents) that produces the deliverable using controlled processes, templates, and governed access to company and end-client context. Humans then review, humanize, and deliver the final output to clients. MVP focuses on Design and Marketing deliverables.

## Vision Statement (updated)

Enable companies to reliably produce high-quality, professional client deliverables at scale by deploying governed AI agents that execute production work end-to-end, while keeping humans in control of final polish and client delivery, with enterprise-grade protection of company and end-client IP.

## Problem Statement (updated)

Service teams are expected to deliver a growing volume of recurring, high-stakes client outputs, but production depends on manual effort, scattered tools, and inconsistent execution. Even when AI is introduced, it often happens in unsecured, public tools that do not protect end-client IP or enforce how deliverables are produced. Companies need a secure, controlled system where AI agents can generate deliverables consistently using approved methods and guarded context, then hand off to humans for professional refinement and client-facing delivery.

## Key Objectives (updated)

- Agent-owned production: route requests to AI Agent Owners (or agent clusters) that complete deliverables, not to human assignees.
- Controlled output: allow companies to control what agents produce (deliverable types, formats, tone) and how they produce it (templates, steps, rules, approvals).
- Protected environment: restrict access to paying companies and enforce strong data isolation so end-client IP is protected.
- Human-in-control handoff: provide a clean review, editing, and packaging layer so humans can professionalize outputs before delivery.
- MVP focus: launch with Design and Marketing deliverable generation and delivery, then expand to Development, Sales, Strategy, Operations.
